        <h2>Reflection of The Program</h2>
        <p><h3>I am very lucky and grateful that I was able to be included in the ATM program. Having it for 3 years not only taught me new programs and how to use a computer, it gave me the ability to use a computer without problems and get ahead in classes. Being able to know how to work a program or complete an activity that most people would have trouble accessing and doing, benefits my grade and time management. It gives me more time to do other things. ATM has given me a whole new level of understanding that n0t only myself will benefit, but my family will as well. I am very grateful to the ATM program as well as my ATM teachers for this wonderful 3 year experience of understanding.</h3></p>

        <h2>Beginning of a Long Journey</h2>
        <p><h3>Ever since I was 3, I had a soccerball at my feet. I was just a young girl at the time and everything was new and interesting to me. But this was a time when I didn't know any better. I would watch as the game played out in front of me. The stampede of little feet running past as I just stood mounted to my spot. Shouts and encouraging praises faded in the background as I stared up at the flying object. Who would think that a butterfly would be so fascinating? Who would've thought that the girl that was entranced by an insect would become a national player.</h3></p>

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p><h3>When I'm not working or at school, I grab a book or just pop my earbuds in my ears and listen to music. I love to write stories online for others to see and I don't mind spending a while doing so. Each chapter I write takes about an hour with the actual typing including the grammar checks. Nevertheless, writing is very relaxing. Plopping down with an electronic from time to time is a way for me to pass some time.
        At the moment, writing stories online and business economics hold my interest. I am currently in the process of writing 7 stories, one is already completed and one I am rewriting. I've always been good at controlling organization, management, and strategy and business economics include that. This interest might influence my career choice in the future but for now it is just an enjoyable interest I have at the moment.</h3>

        <h2>Clubs and Volunteer</h2>
        <p><h3>I am involved in many clubs going back to elementary school. Today, I am in the California Junior Scholarship Federation, CJSF, Genius Bar, and DEN Leaders. CJSF is an Honor Society whose purpose is to foster high standards of scholarship, service, and citizenship for students in grades 7 and 8. Genius Bar is a club that specializes in technology and is set to help other students/staff/teachers who need one on one help with computers. DEN Leaders is a group that students can approach if they are in need of help. I've also volunteered in helping coaching younger kids in soccer at their practices.</h3></p>
